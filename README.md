# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of machine learning projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks


Projects:
### Herbal Plant classification using the convolutional neural network method with ResNet50 architecture using the PyTorch framework and the dataset can be downloaded at the following [link for dataset of types of herbal plants](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anefiamutiaraatha/dataset-tanaman-herbal). [Click here to go to project of herbal plants classification](https://github.com/farhanriyandi/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Herbal%20Plants%20Classification/Herbal%20Plants%20Classification.ipynb).

Course:
I learned machine learning on the YouTube channel Jcop Untuk Indonesia [Click this link for the YouTube channel that I followed to learn on this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBEkakt_ybI&list=PLGn1wRmlR3MvipYvFEnnmaTwd59XjSyrG&index=1) in this course I learned how the KNN algorithm works and modeling using scikit-learn and learned how to use hyperparameter tuning GridSearchCV and how to improve our model is generally divided into 2: namely 1 improving through data and 2 improving through models. [this is the result of what I learned](https://github.com/farhanriyandi/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/tree/main/KNN%20%26%20Scikit%20-%20Learn)
