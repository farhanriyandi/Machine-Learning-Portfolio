# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of machine learning projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks


#### Projects:
### Herbal Plant classification using the convolutional neural network method with ResNet50 architecture using the PyTorch framework and the dataset can be downloaded at the following [link for dataset of types of herbal plants](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anefiamutiaraatha/dataset-tanaman-herbal).
